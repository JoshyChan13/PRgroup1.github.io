                        movement known as Impressionism. Monet was born on November 14, 1840, and even as a young man
                        he was known for producing small portraits in charcoal. In 1858 Monet met the artist Eugène Boudin, who
                        became his mentor and introduced Monet to painting outdoors,</h1>

                        to imitate nature realistically, but in his landscape painting Monet instead sought to portray nature as it
                        appeared to him. In particular, he was interested in how light affects the ways that we perceive color.</h1>

                        times of day, showing how changes in natural light make the cathedral appear to change color. In 1883,
                        Monet moved to a small French town called Giverny, where he built an elaborate garden. This garden,  in
                        particular its water lily ponds,</h1>
