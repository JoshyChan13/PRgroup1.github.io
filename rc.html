                    <h1>On January 3, 1961, nine days after Christmas, Richard Legg, John Byrnes, and Richard
                        McKinley were killed in a remote desert in eastern Idaho. Their deaths occurred when a nuclear reactor
                        exploded at a top-secret base in the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS). Official reports state that
                        the explosion and subsequent reactor meltdown resulted from the improper retraction of the control rod.</h1>

                        fact, was not discussed much, and seemed to disappear with time. In order to grasp the mysterious nature of the NRTS catastrophe, it helps to know a bit about how
                        nuclear reactors work. After all, the generation of nuclear energy may strike many as an esoteric process. However, given its relative simplicity,</h1>

                        comprehensible. In this particular kind of reactor, a cluster of nine-ton uranium fuel rods are positioned
                        lengthwise around a central control rod. The reaction begins with the slow removal of the control rod,
                        which starts a controlled nuclear reaction and begins to heat the water in the reactor. This heat generates
                        steam, which builds pressure inside the tank. As pressure builds,</h1>

                        The only place this steam is able to escape is through the turbine. As it passes through the turbine on its
                        way out of the tank, it turns the giant fan blades and produces energy. On the morning of January 3, after the machine had been shut down for the holidays, the three
                        men arrived at the station to restart the reactor. The control rod needed to be pulled out only four inches
                        to be reconnected to the automated driver.</h1>

                        on the ceiling; he would be discovered last. It took one week and a lead-shielded crane to remove his
                        body. Even in full protective gear, workers were only able to work a minute at a time. The three men are
                        buried in lead-lined coffins under concrete in New York, Michigan, and Arlington Cemetery, Virginia.</h1>
