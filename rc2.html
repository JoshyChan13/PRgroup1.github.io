                        get puppies. After all, puppies are cute, friendly, and playful. But even though puppies make good pets,
                        there are good reasons why you should consider getting an adult dog instead.When you get a puppy, you have to teach it how to behave. You have to make sure that the
                        puppy is housebroken so that it does not go to the bathroom inside the house.
